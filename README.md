# stop-Watch-Clock
# This project is part of my internship at StaxTech, where I am working as a Python Developer Intern. The main focus of this internship is to improve my hands-on coding experience and build practical projects using Python. As part of my learning journey, I developed a Digital Clock and Stopwatch using Python and its built-in libraries.This project is divided into two key components:
# 1. Digital Clock
# The digital clock displays the current system time in real-time using the 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS). It refreshes every second and provides a clear, accurate representation of the current time. The clock interface is built using the Tkinter GUI framework, which allowed me to design a visually clean layout and implement real-time updates using the after() function.
# 2. Stopwatch
# The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer. It is designed to count time from zero and display the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. When the "Start" button is pressed, the stopwatch begins counting. The "Stop" button pauses the timer, and "Reset" clears it to start again from 0:00:00. This section of the project helped me understand how to manage time using Python’s time module and how to handle user events within a GUI application.
# The goal of this internship task was to:
Strengthen my Python programming foundation.
Learn how to build GUI-based applications using Tkinter.
Handle time-based events and update interface elements dynamically.
Practice clean and organized code writing using functions and logic separation.
Real-time digital clock that updates every second.
Functional stopwatch with:
Start
Stop
Reset
How to manage time events using Python’s time and after() functions.
How to organize code using functions, global variables, and event-driven programming
Basic debugging, testing, and UI layout alignment.
How to use GitHub for version control and open-source contribution.
This task helped me build confidence in writing Python code for real-time applications and gave me a strong understanding of how to combine logic and GUI design. I'm proud to include this project as part of my internship portfolio with StaxTech and excited to continue learning and developing more advanced applications.
